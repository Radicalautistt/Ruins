The following is an attempt to recreate [Ruins](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Ruins) area (aproximately 30 minutes long) from [Undertale](https://undertale.com/) game in Haskell. The sole purpose of this project is to serve as a stepping stone towards using Haskell to implement something I'm actually interested in, and also grasping some basic gamedev techniques in the process. All of the resources have been taken from [the first google result of the 'undertale resources' query](https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/undertale/) with some minute tweaking done by myself.
